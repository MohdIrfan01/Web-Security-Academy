Lab #06: Method-based access control can be circumvented

1. Login with admin cred and there is functionality for upgrading a user. Upgrade the user and intercept the request and send it to repeater

2. Login with normal user in an incognito browser and copy the cookie and paste it into the burp repeater. Change the username to your user
You will get the error 'Unauthorized', change the method to Get and the user is promoted to Admin.
